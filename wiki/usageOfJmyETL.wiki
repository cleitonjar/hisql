It's very useful for the multiple datasource support sometimes.

= Details =
    # From the download location, decompress the zip file of jmyetl-1.0.2.
    # *Edit the ini file:  jmyetl.ini,  adjust the value of vm.location to your {JAVA_HOME}\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll*.   [please note:] for now, it only supports 32-bit jdk. Even you are in 64-bit OS, please also use 32-bit jdk1.6 and above. The jdk can be any unzipped version.

    # *For the jmyetl.ini, you can also add the following value in new lines*.
      * vmarg.1=-Xms64M
      * vmarg.2=-Xmx512M
    # Open JmyETL.exe, fill in the {host}, {database}, {port} information for the 
     source db and target db. Click the test connect to ensure they are both connected.
    # click start import.
    # For Access Database, you need not create the mdb file in advance. If it doesn't exist, the tool will create it for you. 如果Access数据库文件不存在，工具会为你自动创建一个mdb数据库文件。
